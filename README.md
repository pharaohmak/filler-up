# Gallon Conversion Calculator

## Overview
This JavaScript application converts a given number of gallons into quarts, pints, or cups based on user selection. It provides a simple interface where users can input the number of gallons and choose the desired conversion type.

## Features
- Converts gallons to quarts, pints, or cups based on user selection.
- Dynamically updates the conversion results on button click.

## Usage
1. Enter the number of gallons in the input field.
2. Select the desired conversion type (Quart, Pint, or Cup) using radio buttons.
3. Click the "Convert" button to see the conversion results.

## Code Explanation
The JavaScript code attached to the "Convert" button performs the following:
- Retrieves the input value (gallons) from the user.
- Validates and checks the selected radio button for conversion type (quart, pint, or cup).
- Calculates the conversion based on the selected radio button.
- Updates the respective result fields (quart-result, pint-result, cup-result) with the calculated values.

## Example
If you enter `5` gallons and select "Quart" for conversion:
- The application calculates `5 * 4 = 20` quarts.
- Updates the Quart result field with `20`.

Similarly, selecting "Pint" would convert `5` gallons to `5 * 8 = 40` pints.
